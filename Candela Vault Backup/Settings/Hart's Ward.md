The stereotypical "middle class" area of the city. 

The buildings in this area are primarily dual purpose buildings. The upper floors serving as housing for families, with the lower floors operating as storefronts and businesses. 
It is not uncommon for the owners and workers of any given business to all live in the same building that they work in, granted the owners and employees living on different floors.
