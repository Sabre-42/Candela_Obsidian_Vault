After a particularly difficult winter season, Raymonds father was let go at the factory, this caused Raymonds family to be dire financial straits. His father turning to alcohol and his mother to attempting to gamble away the rest of the pennies that they had in hopes of winning all that they could ever need, she was never successful. During this period of neglect, the families living conditions deteriorated drastically, with bills piling up unpaid and no food on the table, it was simply a matter of time before something went terribly wrong. 

One evening, smoke and flames filled the families apartment, causing everyone to flee who could. Raymond and Theodore ended up getting trapped in the apartment during their escape attempt. Raymond managed to pry an opening large enough to fit them, but only one at a time, Raymond went first since was the stronger one who opened their escape in the first place. But Theodore was not so lucky. Shortly after Raymond exited the burning apartment, the ceiling collapsed on top of Theodore, right before Raymonds eyes.
