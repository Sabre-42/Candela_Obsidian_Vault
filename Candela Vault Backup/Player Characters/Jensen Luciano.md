Player Background: 
Jensen XXX was found digging through the trash of the [[Five Points Bar]], owned by the now famous [[Charles "Lucky" Luciano]] mob boss to the Luciano crime family. 

Rather than beating the kid within an inch of his life for rooting through his stuff, Lucky was feeling rather generous that day, he took the kid in and gave him a chance to prove himself. 
Lucky was hosting a card game that night as a startup to his new business venture, an underground gambling ring, and set the kid up as the card dealer. 
To Lucky's surprise, Jensen thrived in that roll, truly having a knack for wheeling and dealing anything that dealt with cards, coins, or bottles. 
In an unusual show of uncharacteristic mercy, Lucky kept the kid around, give me a roof to sleep under, taught him how to tend to the bar, how to fight in the street, in particularly well seeded nights Lucky taught Jensen mob politics and manipulation tactics. 

Having grown up in the [[Five Points Bar]], Jensen took on the Luciano name, running the bar, and turning it in a highly popular spot for all persons of the city regardless of class or economical status. In the late evening hours Jensen runs Lucky's gambling games, serving as dealer, bookie, and drink keeper.
