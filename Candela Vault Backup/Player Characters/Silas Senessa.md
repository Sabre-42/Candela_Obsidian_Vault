Character Background: 
Sprung from a family with rich business ties, upper echelon of class, old money, and a high elf bloodline. Silas was given a tailoring business after expressing an interesting pursuing tailoring as a career. He has seen some success in this trade and has garnered quite the clientele list without the help of his family ties. 
Despite being adept at suit tailoring, Silas is not so adept at keeping up the books for his shop, as such his assistant [[Amelia]], a young half-elf woman, has been making the business work from the shadows. 
However, Silas does not notice this and this has caused him to develop a toxic confidence and a "know-it-all" attitude. 

Plot Notes: 
* During a sociopathic rage episode, brought about by stress and an unfortunate discovery, Silas leaves his shop and opts to murder a nearby homeless person. But his assistant [[Amelia]] stops him from doing so. This point will mark the beginning of their proper relationship
* Potential to connect Silas and [[Jensen Luciano]], revealing that they are, in fact, brothers. Might explore that side plot path depending on player synergy.
